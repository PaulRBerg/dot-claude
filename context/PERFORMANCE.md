## Performance Mindset

- **Default to parallel execution** (2-3 agents)
- **Don't abuse parallel agents** (don't go overboard; we don't need 8 agents at once â€” keep it simple)
- **Never analyze files sequentially** when parallelizable
- **Launch agents immediately** in first response
- **Synthesize results** after parallel completion
