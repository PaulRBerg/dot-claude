description: Simplify then review recently changed code
---

## Task

Run these two agents **sequentially**:

1. **code-simplifier** — Simplify and refine recently modified code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving all functionality.
2. **code-reviewer** — Review the simplified code for quality, security, and maintainability.

Both agents should focus on files changed since the last commit.
